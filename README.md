Something sticks  
and then breaks open  
it hums, follows  
	coordination and distance. 

Sky highway,  
		teach us  
direction! 

I hum, follow  
murmurations. 

Swarming, growing,  
creating better  
I try to be in harmony,  
	make decisions.

Heat under the veil,  
I'm sweating â€“   
something sticks on my skin  
like background noise.
